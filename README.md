## Official Dragon's Beard Candy website.
Welcome to Dragon's Beard Candy's official website.

After designing it and building it using Weebly in my early teenage years, I finally picked back up the slack and redesigned it from scratch, of course, this time, without using Weebly.

## Back to basics
Redesigns are never easy - the most important notion is to understand what's the purpose of it all.
Bearing that in mind, there were three things I wanted to incorporate: consistency, simplicity and intuitiveness. Rather than creating a design system that was overly complicated, it was important to keep in mind that converging my ideas into short and sweet elements could be as impactful as a jam-packed user interface. That being said, all three elements were to bring forth one feeling: **curiosity**.

## Curiosity
As the products in questions were quite unfamiliar to the average person, using on the scene pictures became the most obvious choice, and with each carefully selected picture, represented a specific moment of its creation. As for text, using Helvetica Neue as its base was due to its legibility: it was the perfect middle ground between all the different edges of feelings.

## Results
