## Official Dragon's Beard Candy website.
Welcome to Dragon's Beard Candy's official website.

After designing it and building it using Weebly in my early teenage years, I finally had the chance and redesign it from scratch, of course, this time, without using Weebly.

## Back to basics
Redesigns are never easy - the most important notion is to understand what's the purpose of it all.
Bearing that in mind, there were three things I wanted to incorporate: consistency, simplicity and intuitiveness. Rather than creating a design system that was overly complicated, it was important to keep in mind that converging my ideas into short and sweet elements could be as impactful as a jam-packed user interface. 
With a combination of carefully selected pictures, positioning and choice of legible font, my goal was to bring forth one feeling: **curiosity**.
